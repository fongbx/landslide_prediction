# Case Study on Landslide Susceptibility Prediction in Hong Kong
A case study for predicting landslide susceptibility based on terrain information in Hong Kong. To address the issue of imbalanced data, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to expand the quantity of landslide samples. Results indicated that across all models, the usage of balanced data have led to improved outcomes, with recursive partitioning approaches like Bootstrap Forest and Boosted Tree generally performing better compared to logistic regression.

## Data Sources
The dataset is obtained from the Landslide Prevention and Innovation Challenge on Zindi Africa Platform that is provided by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2022). Refer to <https://zindi.africa/competitions/landslide-prevention-and-innovation-challenge>.

## File Description
This project was conducted using JMP Pro. The files include the JMP Pro working files, the final landslide poster and research paper.
